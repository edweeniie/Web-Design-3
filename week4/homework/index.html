		<h2>Brief History of Circus</h2>
		<h5>The Greatest Show on Earth</h5>
		<p class="lead pb-5">
  				George Speaight defines the history of circus as "the story of that entertainment of human bodily skills and trained animals that is presented in a ring of approximately 13 metres in diameter with an audience grouped all around it." The form of popular entertainment known as circus developed in England around horse acts.</br></br>

Although travelling zoological exhibitions (known as menageries), acrobats and trick animal acts were all features of entertainment in the eighteenth century and earlier, it was the combination of these features within a circular structure which became known as circus. Philip Astley (1742-1814), the founder of modern circus, staged a show in London in 1768 featuring trick horseback riding and live music. It was presented in a circular structure, and named Astley's Amphitheatre. He later added other acts, such as acrobats, a clown and a band to his performances. However, the term 'circus' to describe this type of exhibition was coined by Astley's contemporary and rival Charles Dibdin, who opened The Royal Circus in London in 1772. </br></br>

Dibdin's term was used internationally to describe the mixture of horsemanship, comic turns and animal acts programmed as a theatrical spectacle. In 1793, John Bill Ricketts opened the first Astley-type circus in the US in Philadelphia. Ricketts' circus featured a rope-walker, a clown, and riding acts. By the start of the nineteenth century the majority of early circuses in America and Europe based their acts on ideas laid down by Philip Astley. </br></br>

By the middle of the Victorian era travelling circuses had become large commercial concerns ranging from small tenting affairs to gigantic enterprises housed in permanent buildings or amphitheatres. For the first half of the nineteenth century, circus was largely performed in wooden buildings rather than in tents and proprietors such as Frederick "Charles" Hengler constructed purpose-built buildings known as hippodromes, circuses and amphitheatres in cities throughout the United Kingdom.
